If this model succeeds, it can fundamentally shift the power in the news business from the publishing companies to the individual editors\/authors\/experts and can encourage quality journalism. expertnews.me also bridges the gap between &#8220;professional&#8221; journalists and &#8220;amateur&#8221; bloggers - you are either an &#8220;expert&#8221; for your topics or you are not based on your stories and not based on your pay check.  <\/p>\n\n<p>expertnews uses a facebook-style feed-view to show users the news that are most relevant to them. Users can customize their feed by following experts (i.e. a single person from a newspaper or a complete blog) from the expert directory with a single click on &#8220;follow&#8221; or by adding their own experts. expertnews.me uses both the RSS-feed and twitter of the expert as data sources (more data sources (facebook, &#8230;) can be also be added later). <\/p>\n\n<p>Main Features in overview:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Follow news in a simple feed format (which you are used to from facebook)<\/li>\n<li>Discover the best an most important sources\/experts for your topics in the expert directory<\/li>\n<li>Compile expert teams around specific topics (e.g. Hamburg or iphone development) and share them<\/li>\n<li>Share and comment your stories easily via facebook and\/or twitter<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Since expertnews.me has the technology to take out single experts\/authors from a complete newspaper RSS-feeds, authors\/experts\/editors get more bargaining power: Users no longer &#8220;buy the newspaper&#8221; - they follow individual editors who they trust in specific topics. Users can be their own &#8220;publishing house&#8221; and compile their own editorial staff. If authors\/experts change their employer, they will take their &#8220;followers&#8221; with them.

The translation process at tolingo starts with the nifty little cost calculator on our homepage which allows customers to get an instant quote as well as an estimated delivery time for their text. As soon as the customer confirms the order, the digital copy of the text is sent to tolingo&#8217;s database and then picked up by an available translator with suitable language skills and specialist experience. The translator then translates the text using tolingo&#8217;s online software which simultaenously allows the customer to keep track of the order progress. After the translation is completed and once any necessary proofreading\/correction is carried out, the finished order is delivered to the customer. This direct and unbureacratic chain from customer to translator to customer allows tolingo to handle a large volume of orders day and night and dramatically reduce customer waiting time.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the launch of tolingo.com, tolingo hopes to reach both customers and translators on a worldwide scale.
